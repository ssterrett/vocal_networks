## Analysis and modeling of vocalization using neural networks
Two notebooks that can be used to generate vocalization spectrograms. CVAE_128 is a convolutional variational autoenocder and vaegan128 is a variational autoencoder generative-adversarial network, which also contains some code for griffin-lim inversion of the spectrograms to create audio files. This work has greatly been influenced by Jack Goffinet (https://github.com/jackgoffinet/autoencoded-vocal-analysis) and Tim Sainburg (https://github.com/timsainb/AVGN).
